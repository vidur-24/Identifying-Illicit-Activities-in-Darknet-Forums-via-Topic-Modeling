This dataset is one of twenty-three forums which were collected up through 2012 by the Artificial Intelligence Lab to support its Dark Web project on the study of international Jihadi social media and movement.  Each collection contains up to millions of postings written by thousands of forum members.  Postings are organized into threads which generally indicate the topic under discussion.  Each posting includes detailed metadata such as date, member name, etc. Each forum is provided as a downloadable compressed text file which may then be opened in any CSV-compatible text processing program.
